# DAA-Assignment-2
Ford Fulkerson Algo amd Best Fit Line Algo

Objective: In this project, you have to implement two algorithms
1. Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the maximum flow and minimum cut.

Task 1: To implement the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm. Please note that you should not implement any other
algorithm but the one explained in class.
Task 2: Implement the subroutine to find the minimum st-cut of a network flow graph.
Task 3: Use the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for solving Bipartite Matching problem. 
Task 4: Run your algorithm on different kinds of network flow graph for tasks 1 and 3. Smaller graphs to test your code and larger graphs to verify the robustness of implementations. Some of the bipartite graphs
can be found in Stanford repository.

2. The line fitting dynamic programming algorithm (segmented least squares algorithm) done in class.
Task 5: Implementing the actual algorithm 
Task 6: Implement a visualization of the input and output using Python/Java. 
Task 7: Record your experimental results along with the documentation of algorithm. Develop HTML pages to document the results produced by your code, issues in coding, general discussion on the algorithm,
timing analysis, references, and any other remarks. 

Task 8: Use software Doxygen to produce the code documentation.
